# Silksong Completion Checklist
A checklist for a 100% walkthrough in Hollow Knight: Silksong made in Google Sheets and Apps Script.

One of the biggest problems in Silksong is keeping track of what you did. So, I made this quick checklist in Google Sheets to keep track on everything.

## How to use
1. Open the [Silksong Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xxiYxq_7dUgdJXXlLF-7na2fh2xzDHrvYvvWrr1ixVo/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Go to File > Make a copy.
3. You can now tick the checkboxes!
4. If you wish to reset your progress, tick the checkbox next to "Clear All".
